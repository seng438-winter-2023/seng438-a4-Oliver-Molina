# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 
## __Survived__
### Negated double field lower  
```java
public boolean contains(double value)  
{
        return (value >= this.lower && value <= this.upper);
}
```
In this test case a negation of the lower bound still 
resulted in the the same return value since since our test cases did not use large enough lower and upper bounds for such a bug to be noticed i.e Range.lower = 0.  
###  Post Incrementation/Decrementation in line 225 of Range.combine():  
```java
return new Range(l, u)
```  
 Post incrementation of the values l or u is not detected since the operation is happening post construction of the return object, such an error should be irrelevant as the program stands but could cause errors with future iterations.
### Change to conditional boundaries unoticed
 ```java
    public static Range scale(Range base, double factor) {
        ParamChecks.nullNotPermitted(base, "base");
        if (factor < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Negative 'factor' argument.");
        }
        return new Range(base.getLowerBound() * factor,
                base.getUpperBound() * factor);
    }
 ```
Changes to the boundaries of factor are such as changing it to greater than or equal to are not caught with our tests, the set of inputs we run our test cases on should be expanded to include the such possible boundary conditions.

### No coverage for value = 0 condition
```java
    private static double shiftWithNoZeroCrossing(double value, double delta) {
        if (value > 0.0) {
            return Math.max(value + delta, 0.0);
        }
        else if (value < 0.0) {
            return Math.min(value + delta, 0.0);
        }
        else {
            return value + delta;
        }
    }
```
In the last return line, any alterations to return  value + delta, are unnoticed as our test cases did not account for this case which could have resulted in major errors.

### Replace int return with 0 for org/jfree/data/Range::hashCode
```java
    public int hashCode() {
        int result;
        long temp;
        temp = Double.doubleToLongBits(this.lower);
        result = (int) (temp ^ (temp >>> 32));
        temp = Double.doubleToLongBits(this.upper);
        result = 29 * result + (int) (temp ^ (temp >>> 32));
        return result;
    }
```
This test was designed to check for consistent hash code return values however it did not validate whether or not the values returned were infact the correct value.
## __Killed__

### Negated conditional 
```java
public static Range combine(Range range1, Range range2) {
    if (range1 == null) {
        return range2;
    }
    if (range2 == null) {
        return range1;
    }
    double l = Math.min(range1.getLowerBound(), range2.getLowerBound());
    double u = Math.max(range1.getUpperBound(), range2.getUpperBound());
    return new Range(l, u);
}
```
This is an example of a very simple mutation. In this tested injection, the PIT test changes `range2 == null` to `range2 != null`. It's pretty expected that a change like this would survive; however, it is important to test even small and obvious things to ensure the program is of high functionality as one would expect. The mutated bug is obviously killed as it will return range1 before being able actually combine the ranges.

### Replaced boolean return value with false for org/jfree/data/Range::equals
```java
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (!(obj instanceof Range)) {
        return false;
    }
    Range range = (Range) obj;
    if (!(this.lower == range.lower)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (!(this.upper == range.upper)) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
This is another simply mutation. It replaces the final return value from `true` to `false`. While simple, this mutation is important because it ensures that the main outputs are tested by the suite.

### Remove call to org/jfree/data/Range::\<init\>
```java
public static Range expand(Range range,
                            double lowerMargin, double upperMargin) {
    ParamChecks.nullNotPermitted(range, "range");
    double length = range.getLength();
    double lower = range.getLowerBound() - length * lowerMargin;
    double upper = range.getUpperBound() + length * upperMargin;
    if (lower > upper) {
        lower = lower / 2.0 + upper / 2.0;
        upper = lower;
    }
    return new Range(lower, upper);
}
```
This mutation is a good example because it demonstrates a mutation where a core part of the code is removed. Upon removing the call to `Range(lower, upper)` it truly tests the boundaries of the functionality of the code. Not only is the return value essentially destroyed, the the use of the Range constructor is removed thus breaking the code. If a test case were to not catch this or this mutation were to have survived, it would demonstrate a massive breach in the stability of the program.

### Replaced double subtraction with addition/division/multiplication/modulus
```java
public double getLength() {
    return this.upper - this.lower;
}
```
I grouped up multiple mutations here because they are very similar and do essentially the same thing, and are all killed in the same way. They replace the subtract operator `-` with either an addition `+`, division `/`, multiplication `*`, or modulus `%`. This ruins the mathematical equation that the subtraction is meant to return, and will not allow the mutation to survive.

### Negated double local variable number 1 (or 3)
```java
public Range(double lower, double upper) {
    if (lower > upper) {
        String msg = "Range(double, double): require lower (" + lower
            + ") <= upper (" + upper + ").";
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(msg);
    }
    this.lower = lower;
    this.upper = upper;
}
```
With this, the lower or upper variable are negated. This would make the the larger variable smaller and vice versa. This would, in every case besides some 0s, cause the test case to fail if done properly. This is a great mutation as it tests the test case.
