# Introduction
In our previous assignments our group has been tasked with testing the JFreeChart program using manual, exploratory, black-box and white-box testing methods. In this lab we will continue to expand our comprehensive testing of the program by employing mutation testing, which is when small modifications to the code are injected to intentionally cause problems in the form of mutants. Tests are designed around the mutated sections of code with the philosophy that tests that are able to cover small simple error will be able to catch more realistic and complex errors as well. To perform this mutation testing we use Pitest/Pitclipse to automate the creations of mutations and running mutation tests on a set of test cases with the end goal being increasing the mutation score and thus increasing the test coverage.

As part of the assignment we also take a brief look into Web/GUI testing by using the Selenium IDE and Sikulix in Chrome on the Costco website to generate UI test case scripts and automate their execution. Selenium IDE records a series of inputs in a website and verifies that a tested sequence works as intended. Verification points are used to ensure the correct behavior occurs.

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 
## __Survived__
### Negated double field lower  
```java
public boolean contains(double value)  
{
        return (value >= this.lower && value <= this.upper);
}
```
In this test case a negation of the lower bound still 
resulted in the the same return value since since our test cases did not use large enough lower and upper bounds for such a bug to be noticed i.e Range.lower = 0.  
###  Post Incrementation/Decrementation in line 225 of Range.combine():  
```java
return new Range(l, u)
```  
 Post incrementation of the values l or u is not detected since the operation is happening post construction of the return object, such an error should be irrelevant as the program stands but could cause errors with future iterations.
### Change to conditional boundaries unoticed
 ```java
    public static Range scale(Range base, double factor) {
        ParamChecks.nullNotPermitted(base, "base");
        if (factor < 0) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException("Negative 'factor' argument.");
        }
        return new Range(base.getLowerBound() * factor,
                base.getUpperBound() * factor);
    }
 ```
Changes to the boundaries of factor are such as changing it to greater than or equal to are not caught with our tests, the set of inputs we run our test cases on should be expanded to include the such possible boundary conditions.

### No coverage for value = 0 condition
```java
    private static double shiftWithNoZeroCrossing(double value, double delta) {
        if (value > 0.0) {
            return Math.max(value + delta, 0.0);
        }
        else if (value < 0.0) {
            return Math.min(value + delta, 0.0);
        }
        else {
            return value + delta;
        }
    }
```
In the last return line, any alterations to return  value + delta, are unnoticed as our test cases did not account for this case which could have resulted in major errors.

### Replace int return with 0 for org/jfree/data/Range::hashCode
```java
    public int hashCode() {
        int result;
        long temp;
        temp = Double.doubleToLongBits(this.lower);
        result = (int) (temp ^ (temp >>> 32));
        temp = Double.doubleToLongBits(this.upper);
        result = 29 * result + (int) (temp ^ (temp >>> 32));
        return result;
    }
```
This test was designed to check for consistent hash code return values however it did not validate whether or not the values returned were infact the correct value.
## __Killed__

### Negated conditional 
```java
public static Range combine(Range range1, Range range2) {
    if (range1 == null) {
        return range2;
    }
    if (range2 == null) {
        return range1;
    }
    double l = Math.min(range1.getLowerBound(), range2.getLowerBound());
    double u = Math.max(range1.getUpperBound(), range2.getUpperBound());
    return new Range(l, u);
}
```
This is an example of a very simple mutation. In this tested injection, the PIT test changes `range2 == null` to `range2 != null`. It's pretty expected that a change like this would survive; however, it is important to test even small and obvious things to ensure the program is of high functionality as one would expect. The mutated bug is obviously killed as it will return range1 before being able actually combine the ranges.

### Replaced boolean return value with false for org/jfree/data/Range::equals
```java
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (!(obj instanceof Range)) {
        return false;
    }
    Range range = (Range) obj;
    if (!(this.lower == range.lower)) {
        return false;
    }
    if (!(this.upper == range.upper)) {
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
```
This is another simply mutation. It replaces the final return value from `true` to `false`. While simple, this mutation is important because it ensures that the main outputs are tested by the suite.

### Remove call to org/jfree/data/Range::\<init\>
```java
public static Range expand(Range range,
                            double lowerMargin, double upperMargin) {
    ParamChecks.nullNotPermitted(range, "range");
    double length = range.getLength();
    double lower = range.getLowerBound() - length * lowerMargin;
    double upper = range.getUpperBound() + length * upperMargin;
    if (lower > upper) {
        lower = lower / 2.0 + upper / 2.0;
        upper = lower;
    }
    return new Range(lower, upper);
}
```
This mutation is a good example because it demonstrates a mutation where a core part of the code is removed. Upon removing the call to `Range(lower, upper)` it truly tests the boundaries of the functionality of the code. Not only is the return value essentially destroyed, the the use of the Range constructor is removed thus breaking the code. If a test case were to not catch this or this mutation were to have survived, it would demonstrate a massive breach in the stability of the program.

### Replaced double subtraction with addition/division/multiplication/modulus
```java
public double getLength() {
    return this.upper - this.lower;
}
```
I grouped up multiple mutations here because they are very similar and do essentially the same thing, and are all killed in the same way. They replace the subtract operator `-` with either an addition `+`, division `/`, multiplication `*`, or modulus `%`. This ruins the mathematical equation that the subtraction is meant to return, and will not allow the mutation to survive.

### Negated double local variable number 1 (or 3)
```java
public Range(double lower, double upper) {
    if (lower > upper) {
        String msg = "Range(double, double): require lower (" + lower
            + ") <= upper (" + upper + ").";
        throw new IllegalArgumentException(msg);
    }
    this.lower = lower;
    this.upper = upper;
}
```
With this, the lower or upper variable are negated. This would make the the larger variable smaller and vice versa. This would, in every case besides some 0s, cause the test case to fail if done properly. This is a great mutation as it tests the test case. 

# Report all the statistics and the mutation score for each test class



# Analysis drawn on the effectiveness of each of the test classes

# A discussion on the effect of equivalent mutants on mutation score accuracy
The effect of equivalent mutants has been to significantly decrease the mutation score of each of our test classes reducing the accuracy greatly. There are many surviving mutants where we can see that the function output is exactly identitical and a few possible methods for detecting equivalent mutants are as follow.
## Possible Automatic Detection Systems
1. Use Regex to identify common equivalent mutants i.e  
x+=y -> x-=(-y)
2. Partition functions into relevant and irrelevant sections i.e  
post incrementaton of temporary variables

## Common Equivalent Mutants
### Post Incremnting local variables
The large majority of equivalent mutants we have seen have been some form of this mutant. In such a case we would never see the effect of the mutation since the variable has already been using and its state is no longer important to the overall outcome of the program.
#### Original
```java
    public Range(double lower, double upper) {
        if (lower > upper) {
            String msg = "Range(double, double): require lower (" + lower
                + ") <= upper (" + upper + ").";
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(msg);
        }
        this.lower = lower; 
        this.upper = upper;
    }
```
#### Mutant
```java
    public Range(double lower, double upper) {
        if (lower > upper) {
            String msg = "Range(double, double): require lower (" + lower
                + ") <= upper (" + upper + ").";
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(msg);
        }
        this.lower = lower++; // <---
        this.upper = upper++;
    }
```
### Negating Double Argument on NaN check
In this mutant, changing the value of the argument has no bearing on the argument's data type so the outcome of the function call will never change.
#### Original
```java
    public boolean isNaNRange() {
        return Double.isNaN(this.lower) && Double.isNaN(this.upper);
    }
```
#### Mutant
```java
    public boolean isNaNRange() {
        return Double.isNaN(-this.lower) && Double.isNaN(-this.upper);
    }
```
# A discussion of what could have been done to improve the mutation score of the test suites
Some surviving mutants were a resulted from weak boundary testing that could be caught with a more advanced set of test preconditions.
Other survivors resulted from our usage of getters to validate a tests outcome when the returned variable of the getter may have also been compromised by the mutation in question, a better practice would be to store the desired results prior to executing the sections of code we are subjecting to scrutiny. 
# Why do we need mutation testing? Advantages and disadvantages of mutation testing
## Advantages
Mutation testing does allow us to see how robust our test cases are with respect to small changes in the source code, this is especially helpful in highlighting the efficacy of our tests in managing boundary conditions. 
## Disadvantages
One major disadvantage of mutation testing is the significant time and resources required to conduct it, this time can be reduced through the eilimination of equivalent mutants but even this process takes time.
