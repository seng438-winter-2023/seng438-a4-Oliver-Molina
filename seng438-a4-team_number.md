# Introduction
We do some things idk 

# Analysis of 10 Mutants of the Range class 
## __Survived__
### Negated double field lower  
```java
public boolean contains(double value)  
{
        return (value >= this.lower && value <= this.upper);
}
```
In this test case a negation of the lower bound still 
resulted in the the same return value since since our test cases did not use large enough lower and upper bounds for such a bug to be noticed i.e Range.lower = 0.  
###  Post Incrementation/Decrementation in line 225 of Range.combine():  
```java
return new Range(l, u)
```  
 Post incrementation of the values l or u is not detected since the operation is happening post construction of the return object, such an error should be irrelevant as the program stands but could cause errors with future iterations.

 ```java

 ```
